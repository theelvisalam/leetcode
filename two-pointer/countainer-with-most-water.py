'''
You are given an integer array heights where heights[i] represents the height of the ithith bar.

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,7,2,5,4,7,3,6]

Output: 36

Explanation: The bars at indices 1 and 7 have heights 7 and 6. The container has width 7 - 1 = 6 and height min(7, 6) = 6, so it can store 6 * 6 = 36 units of water. This is the maximum possible area.

Example 2:

Input: height = [2,2,2]

Output: 4

                w =
